# GitHub Pull Request Rejection Bot

Some projects on GitHub don't accept GitHub Pull Requests. Maybe they have their own contribution processes. Maybe they hate freedom. Either way, GitHub doesn't provide a way to disable pull requests officially.

So I wrote this.

Using this tool, you can effectively disable pull requests for your repo on GitHub. When pull requests are disabled, any time a new one is opened it will immediately be closed by the bot.

Sound fun? [Let's get started](http://nopullrequests.com/user)

(Ironically, this project *does* accept pull requests...)
